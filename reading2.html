            <h3>CH.2 Summary</h3>
            <p>In this chapter, the author explains what transparent technology and opaque technology, which transparent technology means
              that the technology itself used in many of the electronic devices around us in our daily lives, which we are hardly know
              what is happening in those devices while we are using them.
              For example, smartphone, we are so use to use our electronic devices in our daily lives, and many of us do not have a
              conscious as "I am using smartphone right now, to check my SNS or email", but we are just checking those notifications
              or feeds unconsciously. In contrast, there is Opaque technology, where it makes us sense and realize us that we are using
              that "technology". For example, even I mentioned that smartphones are transparent technology, it also could be opaque
              because when people face some technical issue on the system of the device and they struggle, they know that they are trying
              to do something with using devices. Also, driving car is opaque because many people do drive with right conscious, or it
              would cause accident.</p>
           
            <h3>Question 1</h3>
            <p>Transparent technology' means that the technology itself used in technical products such as personal computers, tablets,
              and smartphones cannot be seen. Most people don't know how smartphones and mobile phones can make calls, but most people
              use them well. On the other hand, 'Opaque technology' is a technology that keeps users struggling and requires skills
              and abilities that are not naturally transmitted to naturally living things, so it is attracting attention in everyday
              problem solving. With these opaque technologies, they make a clear and continuous distinction between users and tools.
              The user's ongoing problem is successful deployment and control of the tool.</p>
          
            <h3>Question 2</h3>
            <p>The more the technology polished (developed), the more it becomes transparent which we are not able to see what is happening
              within the devices that we use in our daily lives. As the reading gives us example of artists' sketch, blind person's
              cane, and teenager's phone, they are their use and function have been deeply involved in the biological system, so it can
              be said that they are part of the biological system and are united during use. For example, it would be better if kitchen
              utensils or the recipies become transparent technology, we can cook anything we want without searching around the recipies
              or try to weight every single ingreadients.
              On the other hand, a technology that should be more opaque is car, because nowadays cars are becoming more convenient, where
              people don't even have to drive, AI automaticly drives insttead of human. This still has risk of traffic accident, so it
              should be opaque.</p>
          
            <h3>Question 3</h3>
            <p>In my opinion, the watch cases did valid to me because as in the reading says, when someone asks me the time, I am sure I have my
              time with me and willing to answer their question. It is obviously not based on my knowledge of knowing the time, but it seems
              and it feels like I do know because I have my time on my wrist or a tip of the finger. For the dictionary example, when people
              ask me the meaning of a specific term, and if it is something that I know or remember from my memory, I would answer, and if it
              doesn't, I might go search with google or dictionary, but that does not mean that I have the meaning for the term.</p>
