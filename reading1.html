            <h3>CH.1 Summary</h3>
            <p>
          In the first chapter, it explains that there are already some processes developed.
These days, the electronic devices are getting close to our body as a physical position.
When the computer was born, it needed a dedicated room, but it has become smaller and more portable.
The variety is increasing, and so-called wearable devices are attached to the body in the form of
glasses or watches and from this rapid development, it is natural to think that eventually it will be
integrated with the skin and enter the inside of our body.

The first idea of "cyborg", which is the word came from 'Cybernetic Organisms' was established by Manfred Clynes
band Nathan Kline, who are both working for the Dynamic Simulation Laboratory. At a distance from the debate over
whether humans should become cyborgs, Andy Clark argues that "humans are naturally born as cyborgs" and that the link
between the body and technology is a cyborg, but it is also a human nature that has been seen for a long time. What is
special about the human brain, and what best describes the distinguishing features of human intelligence, is its ability
to establish deep and complex relationships with abiotic constructs. However, this ability does not depend on the physical
fusion of the wire-implant method, but rather on our openness to information processing fusion. As anyone who has ever felt
as if they were thinking through the act of writing, this information processing fusion can be achieved without invading the
body by any of the electric devices. In other words, what is important is not that the object enters the body, but that the
object and the body interact and cooperate with each other.
            </p>
    
            <h3>Question 1</h3>
            <p>
              The traditional Klines and Clines definition of the cyborg is to connect biological organisms with the electronical devices,
or the data processing, which the injected electronic devices uses the feedback signal from the body to automatically
regulate wakefulness, metabolism, respiration, heart rate, and other physiological functions in the way adapted to the
environment. On the other hand, Clark states that we are not becoming one with the electronic devices, instead we are
already born as cyborgs, which we have an ability to establish deep and complex relationship with abiotic constructs
that does not depend on the physical fusion of wire-implant scheme. This information processing can be achieved without
invading the body with any of the electric devices or silicon or wires.
            </p>
   
            <h3>Question 2</h3>
            <p>
              One example of self-regulating systems with a non-biological base is a system in which the results of the activity of the
system itself are "feedbacked" and the activity is increased, stopped, started, or decreased depending on the conditions,
which the readings gives us an example of a toilet system. The temperature drops, the circuit operates, and the furnace
operates. The temperature rises, the circuit is cut off, and the furnace shuts down. In addition, the toilet is flushed,
the ballcock falls, and the connected inlet valve opens. Then, on the high tide, water will flow in until the ballcock
reaches a preset level and the valve is closed again. Another example of self-regulating systems with biological base is
that humans function continuously and out of our consciousness to maintain important physiological parameters. With more
effort and less oxygen saturation in the blood, breathing becomes more intense, the heart beats faster, and more oxygen
is pumped into the bloodstream. With less effort and higher blood oxygen levels, breathing and heart rate decrease, and
oxygen intake and intake decrease.
